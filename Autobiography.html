		<h2 style="font-size:150%;">Fitness Life</h2>
		<p style="font-size:135%;">Growing up Tyler was like any other young boy other, he was skinny. He always hate the fact that he was and he had disadvantages and he wanted to do something about it but he knew that it wasn't going to be easy.
		He the age of 16 he started to workout and he had only one goal in mind, to change how he looked. Like for every beginner he didn't know what to do so he would go on YouTube and find workout videos and with that he started. </p> 
		<img src="images/past.jpg" alt="Skinny Tyler" width="410px" height= "580px" />
		
		<p style="font-size:135%;"> He started strong but as the days went by he started to slow down, he started to miss workouts because he never had no motivation. He wanted somebody to be there for him but nobody was ever there. Even though we was seeing some result that still wasn't enough.
		He saw it coming and he stopped working out for months but he decided that he wasn't going to give up that easy and some how he was motivated more than ever. He started watching motivational videos and motivational speech which is his favorite.
		He started to see more results and his body started to gain more muscle and he was doing it slowly but surely. He continue but at this time he never had any equipments but a old iron that he found by he's grandmother's house and he used that and 
		did mostly bodyweight workouts.</p>
		<img src="images/see.jpg" alt="Tyler with some results" width="440px" height= "500px" />

		<p style="font-size:135%;"> Tyler keep doing his work out and he was happy with how he looked so far but something was going to happen that he didn't see coming. In the month of March 2020 his cousin who came home for vacation asked him if he want to workout with him because he was also 
		working out and he was more experience. Tyler didn't even think twice to say "yes" but what he didn't know was that he had to work harder and stronger. Tyler's first week was the hardest and most painful but we never stopped going. He kept going everyday and he was glad somebody was there 
		to guide and motivated him to push harder.
